# Dynamically typed, Primitive Typed and Object

-   ## Dynamically Typed:
    -   Data types can be changed later on and javascript will be fine with that.
    -

-   ## Primitive Typed:
    -   Data types are immutable and cannot be changed later on.

-   ## Object:

# Typecasting: Using Explicit and Implicit coercion
        
- ###   [explicit, ==/=== snippet](./img/image.png)

-   changing from one type to another data type is called Typecasting. Typecasting can be done by coercion.
    -   ## Coercion In datatypes :  
        -   Two different ways we can coerce the varible
            -   ### (Explicit VS. Implicit coercion)

    -   ## Coercion on Boolean:
        -   ###   Truthy and Falsy Values
            -   There are 5 Falsy values
                -   undefined
                -   null
                -   false
                -   +0, -0, NaN
                -   ""
            -   All the Truthy Values are
                -   []  (Empty Array)
                -   {}  (Empty object)
                -   Everything other than Falsy values
    -   ## Comparing values using == and ===
        -   We must never use "==" because it may cause strange behaviour, So always use "===".
